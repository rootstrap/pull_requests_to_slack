Send Github pull request notifications to Slack.

- Each time a PR is created in your organization it will send a message to a specific Slack channel with a link to the PR and its technology emoji assigned.
- When the PR is merged it will add a merged reaction emoji.

- You can add ``` \slack `This is a small pr @slack_user` ``` at the end of the PR's description to add a message to the notification and to notify specific Slack users.

 Make sure to use ``` ` ` ``` in the message in case the Slack user name is the same as someone's GitHub name, so the github user is not notified.

- It will remove the notification if the PR has an `ON HOLD` label and resend the notification when the label is removed.

## How to test the webhook locally?
- Create a dummy repository in github with a couple branches.
- Run server:  `rails s -p 3001`
- In another terminal run ngrok: `ngrok http 3001`
- Copy ngrok url to github configuration page (settings->webhooks)
`http://xxxxxxx.ngrok.io/api/v1/notifications_filter`
- Change CHANNEL in SlackNotificationService to your `@name` or `#some_test_channel`
- Create/edit pull request adding or removing labels. This will execute the webhook.
